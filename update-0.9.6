1. Push to talk audio chat

We implement a push-to-talk feature for anyone who only wants an active mic when talking, also this feature helps to reduce the echo produced by users without a proper headset and microphone.


2. UI & UX improvements

For a better user experience, we always update the Interface to make it more user-friendly.

    Updated:

* Edit Mode
